2. (30 points) Short answer

(1) (6 points) What are the main goals of the operating system? Please answer from the user view and the system view, respectively.

,

(2) (6 points) Please illustrate two advantages of using APIs rather than invoking system calls directly.

(3) (6 points) Please illustrate the advantages of the multiprocessor systems (4 points). What is the possible reason for the problem that, compared to a computer with a single processor, the speed-up ratio of a computer with eight identical processors is less than eight (2 points)?

(4) (6 points) Please summarize the function of the process scheduler in brief (2 points). A common representation of process scheduling is a queueing diagram, including two different types of scheduling queues of processes. Please describe the state of the processes placed in these two types of queues, respectively (4 points).

(5) (6 points) Please illustrate the main advantage of dual-mode operation (i.e., why should the system distinguish between user mode and kernel mode) (2 points) and describe the workflow of dual-mode operation after a user application requests a service via a system call (4 points).

.

3. (40 points) Simple C programs on fork()

For all the C programs below, you can assume that necessary header files are included and fork() always creates a new process successfully.

1) (10 points) Consider the following code segments:

int main(){ pid_t pid, id;

for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++){ ÂìÅ id = fork();

if(id == 0) break; child

} 6b Fabe

pid = getpid(); child rocess if (pid == id) printf(‚Äútrue ‚Äú);

else printf(‚Äúfalse‚àö ‚Äú); p Œî

fflush(stdout); //force the output to be displayed on the console before the program exits return 0;

} T

How many ‚Äútrue‚Äù and ‚Äúfalse‚Äù will be printed, respectively (4 points)? Please elaborate (6 points).

And there Us no process that have pid = 0 , hence the fie child pocesses will outht

which is differetfromthepaventpocess‚Äôs pid .

2) (10 points) Consider the following code segments:

int main(){ if (fork() || fork()){ printf(‚Äútrue ‚Äú);

}

printf(‚Äúprocess ‚Äú);

fflush(stdout);

return 0;

}

How many ‚Äútrue‚Äù will be printed (3 points)? How many ‚Äúprocess‚Äù will be printed (2 points)? Please elaborate (5 points). (Hint: In C language, if State1 is true, ‚ÄúState1 || State2‚Äù will directly return true without checking State2.)

4) (10 points) In this question, we introduce the macro WEXITSTATUS(int status) defined in &lt;sys/wait.h&gt; header. This macro evaluates to the least significant 8 bits of the exit status value that the child process passed to exit(). You can take the following code as an example.

int main(){ int status; pid_t pid = fork(); // Create a child process.

if(pid == 0) exit(50); // The child process terminates and passes 50 as the exit status value.

wait(&amp;status); // The parent process waits and receives the exit status value of the child process.

int value = WEXITSTATUS(status); // value = 50 return 0;

}

In this question, we want to use fork() to implement a dot product between two vectors with multiple processes. For example, given two vectors ! = [3, 2, 4] and ) = [1, 5, 2], the dot product between ! and ) is ! ‚ãÖ ) = 3 ‚àó 1 + 2 ‚àó 5 + 4 ‚àó 2 = 21. The input of our program includes two vectors. The output is the dot product between them.

The input data satisfies the following conditions.

1. The elements of the vectors are all non-negative integers.

2. The number of elements in each vector is fixed to 5.

3. The result of the dot product is less than 256.

Please fill in the five blanks to complete the following program. You can write at most 20 characters in each blank (10 points, 2 points for each blank).

int i, status, product, value;

}

for (i = 0; i &lt; size; i++){

scanf(‚Äú%d‚Äù, &amp;b[i]); // Input vector b

}

}
